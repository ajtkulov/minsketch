    the epsilon parameter, and provides a robust implementation of a count-min sketch using only two hash functions.

    From the paper:
    "In particular, for \
    :math:`w \geq \frac{2e}{\epsilon} \ and \ \delta \geq \ln \frac{1}{\epsilon(1 âˆ’ \frac{1}{2e^2})}`"

    => My assumption is that they mean d, rather than delta, and therefore I report the effective delta.
